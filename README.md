This project demonstrates how to build a tool-using AI agent powered by Llama-2 and LangGraph, capable of interpreting user queries, routing them to tools (like a calculator or search), and producing structured final responses through a graph-based workflow.

Library	:

transformers	- LLM inference pipeline, 
langgraph	- Agent workflow graph and execution, 
langchain_huggingface	- HuggingFace pipeline integration, 
huggingface_hub	- Model authentication and access, 
torch -	Model computing backend, 
typing - Structured agent state using TypedDict
